# druMende

Drumende is an analog drum machine in 70's style. All circuitry is designed so that it could have been built in the late 70's/early 80's.
All sound generators are analog, using transistors and op amps. Sequencer is without microcontroller, only 7400/4000-series discrete logic.

Soundgenerators are modeled according to classic drum machines and also newer designs:
- Boss DR-55: bass drum, snare drum, hi-hat, accent-circuit
- Korg KR-55: bass drum, snare drum, rimshot, claves, noise generator
- Andromeda Space Rockers by Eric Archer: hi-hat, tom hi, tom lo
- 7400 contest entry by Matt Sarnoff: sequencer

The goal has not been to duplicate the original circuits as close as possible. There are several modifications to original circuits.
Also sequencer has experienced serious modifications.

There are 10 sound generators. Because sequencer has only 6 voice channels + accent channel, sound for four channels is selectable.
Each channel level can be controlled with level control knobs. Also each channel has one controllable parameter, tuning or decay time.

Sequencer is 7 channel, 16 steps. Two 7 x 16 step patterns can be stored.
